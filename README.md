# Reservoir Area and Cost Calculation Application

This application calculates the area from a given coordinate list, performs certain operations within this area, and displays the resulting cost. It can typically be used in mining or similar fields.

## Features

- Ability to draw on an area based on given coordinates.
- Placing platforms (in square shapes) within the area.
- Calculation of total reservoir area.
- Calculation of drilling cost, platform cost, and total cost.
- Calculation of profit.

## How to Use

1. Obtain a coordinate list and perform operations on it.
2. The relevant coordinates are drawn in a graphic window.
3. Platforms are placed within the area.
4. The reservoir value of the area is calculated.
5. The number of platforms and costs are calculated.
6. The results are displayed to the user.

## Installation

1. Copy or download the code to your computer.
2. You need a C compiler (such as gcc) and required libraries (curl, graphics.h) to run the code.
3. Run the code.

## Dependencies

- `graphics.h`: Library used for graphical operations.
- `curl`: Library used for sending and receiving HTTP requests.
